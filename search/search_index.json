Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.For full documentation visit mkdocs.org . Installation MkDocs supports Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3 and 3.4. pip install mkdocs Commands mkdocs new [dir-name] - Create a new project. mkdocs serve - Start the live-reloading docs server, hosted at local host. mkdocs build - Build the documentation site. mkdocs -h - Print help message and exit. Project layout mkdocs.yml # The configuration file. docs/ index.md # The documentation homepage. ... # Other markdown pages, images and other files. Adding Pages The process of adding pages consists of two stages: 1.- Add a .md file at the docs directory. 2.- Track the file inside the mkdocs.yml file. Example: user@~\\project\\docs$ touch about.md # Create md file user@~\\project\\docs$ cd .. # Go to parent directory user@~\\project\\$ ls # List Directories docs mkdocs.yml user@~\\project\\$ nano mkdocs.yml # Open and edit yml file GNU nano 2.5.3 New Buffer site_name: MkLorum # Default value nav: # Default value - Home: index.md # Default value - About: about.md # Add new element to track ### save, if page is in local host it will be updated automatically ### Teheming documentation: We can edit the mkdocs.yml to add a theme: site_name: MkLorum pages: - Home: index.md - About: about.md theme: readthedocs For more on theme customization go to the theme section. Building the site In order to build a site we use: mkdocs build This will create a new directory, named site . If you're using source code control such as git you probably don't want to check your documentation builds into the repository. Add a line containing site/ to your .gitignore file. echo \"site/\" >> .gitignore Depolyin your docs to Github Pages Building is necesary in order to host the source code to pages that are not able to host markdown, github pages is able to host markdow so we do not need to build we only need to: 1.- git init , git add * , git commit-m \"message\" , git add remote [origin] , git push 2.- mkdocs gh-deploy --clean Behind the scenes, MkDocs will build your docs and use the ghp-import tool to commit them to the gh-pages branch and push the gh-pages branch to GitHub. Use mkdocs gh-deploy --help to get a full list of options available for the gh-deploy command.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#mkdocs-basics-tutorial","text":"This is a fast and perzonalized tutorial for MKDocs MkDocs is a simple static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation.

What is YAML? YAML (a recursive acronym for \"YAML Ain't Markup Language\") is a human-readable data-serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted How to write YAML The basic structure of a YAML file is a map. A map is made of keys and values all the way down: key: value You can denote a list using dashes: list: - element1: file.txt - element2: file.md - element3: photo.png Configure Pages and Navigation The nav configuration setting in your mkdocs.yml file defines which pages are included in the global site navigation menu as well as the structure of that menu. If not provided, the navigation will be automatically created by discovering all the Markdown files in the documentation directory. An automatically created navigation configuration will always be sorted alphanumerically by file name (except that index files will always be listed first within a sub-section). You will need to manually define your navigation configuration if you would like your navigation menu sorted differently. A minimal navigation configuration could look like this: nav: - 'index.md' - 'about.md' To override the title in the nav setting add a title right before the filename. nav: - Home: 'index.md' - About: 'about.md' Navigation sub-sections can be created by listing related pages together under a section title. For example: All paths in the navigation configuration must be relative to the docs_dir configuration option. If that option is set to the default value, docs, the source files for the above configuration would be located at docs/index.md and docs/about.md nav: - Home: 'index.md' -'User Guide': -'Writing your docs': 'writing-your-docs.md' -'Styling your docs': 'styling-your-docs.md' - About: -'License': 'license.md' -'Release Notes': 'release-notes.md' Themes MkDocs includes a couple built-in themes as well as various third party themes, all of which can easily be customized with extra CSS or JavaScript or overridden from the theme's custom_dir. You can also create your own custom theme from the ground up for your documentation. To use a theme that is included in MkDocs, simply add this to your mkdocs.yml config file. theme: [name of theme] MkDocs comes with some pre-built themes, but you can exapnd your arsenal with Boostrap Themes.
